# Impact-of-Weather-on-Crop-Production-and-Market-price
Investigate the influence weather parameters have on the crop production in specific districts in India, and How 
it affects the prices of the agricultural commodities sold in those regions from 2017 to 2019. This weather data was fetched through an 
Application Programming Interface (API) while the crop production and Item price dataset was made available through a big data repository 
(Kaggle). The analysis showed significantly impactful results on weather changes on crop production and fluctuations in market prices of 
the commodities sold. These findings help us predict the future trends in agriculture and in economic planning.
